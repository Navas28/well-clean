            <h2>Shampoo Application</h2>
            <p>We use specialized eco-friendly shampoo that's tough on stains but gentle on your upholstery. Our unique shampooing process ensures deep cleaning while maintaining the fabric's integrity and color vibrancy. The carefully formulated cleaning solution penetrates deep into the fibers to break down dirt, grime, and stubborn stains, while its pH-balanced formula protects your furniture's natural colors and textures. This professional-grade treatment not only cleans but also helps extend the life of your upholstery by removing harmful contaminants that can degrade fabric over time.</p>

            <h2>Drilling Brush Treatment</h2>
            <p>Our specialized drilling brush technology helps remove deeply embedded dirt and revitalizes your sofa's texture. Using advanced rotary brush attachments, we gently agitate the fabric to loosen stubborn dirt, pet hair, and debris that regular cleaning can't reach. This mechanical action, combined with our cleaning solutions, helps restore the original texture and appearance of your upholstery. The carefully controlled rotation speed ensures thorough cleaning without damaging even delicate fabrics, making it safe for all types of furniture.</p>

            <p>Our powerful drilling and vacuum technology reaches deep into the upholstery fibers, extracting embedded dirt and debris.

Our industrial-grade vacuum equipment uses multi-stage filtration and strong suction power to effectively remove both surface and deeply embedded contaminants.

This deep cleaning process is especially beneficial for homes with pets or allergy sufferers, as it eliminates up to 99% of common household allergens trapped in your furniture.</p>
