            <h2>Vacuuming</h2>
            <p>Our powerful vacuum technology efficiently removes surface dust and debris from your mattress as the first step in our cleaning process. Using industrial-grade equipment with high-powered suction and advanced filtration, we ensure thorough removal of loose particles and allergens. After vacuuming, we apply specialized eco-friendly shampoo and use our drilling brush technology to deep clean the mattress fibers. The mechanical action combined with our cleaning solutions helps break down stubborn stains and embedded dirt. Finally, we use our vacuum system again to extract excess water and any remaining debris, leaving your mattress thoroughly cleaned and properly dried.</p>

            <h2>Removal</h2>
            <p>Our specialized drilling brush technology helps revitalize your mattress's texture. Using advanced rotary brush attachments, we gently agitate the fabric to loosen and remove dust mites, allergens, and other microscopic particles that regular cleaning can't reach. This mechanical action, combined with our cleaning solutions, helps restore the original texture and appearance of your mattress. The carefully controlled rotation speed ensures thorough cleaning without damaging even delicate fabrics, making it safe for all types of mattresses.</p>
